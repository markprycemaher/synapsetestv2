Accounts whose balances are carried forward to the next accounting period.\nAsset, liability and equity accounts are permanent accounts.\n\nNOMINAL ACCOUNT\nA revenue or expense account that is closed into retained earnings at the end of the period.\n\nREAL ACCOUNT\nA balance sheet account, which is the opposite of a nominal account.\n\nCONTRA REVENUE ACCOUNT\nAn account that is offset against a revenue account on the income statement.",
